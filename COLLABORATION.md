# Collaboration Guide

Welcome to the Converge project. We value correctness, clarity, and restraint.

## How We Collaborate

1. **Context-First**: All discussions should be grounded in the shared context of the system.
2. **Alignment over Speed**: We prefer reaching a stable, converged state over moving fast and breaking things.
3. **Transparent Decisions**: Every decision should be explainable and documented.
4. **Human in the Loop**: Human authority is a first-class citizen in our governance model.

## Syncing

- Use the top-level Justfile for common tasks.
- Ensure all CI checks pass locally before proposing changes.
- All documentation should be consolidated into `converge-business/knowledgebase` unless it is project-specific (README.md, AGENTS.md).
