## Notes

# Strategy

Strategy defines the non-negotiables: axioms, platform boundaries, and the
business model that make convergence defensible and adoptable.

## Key Points

- Axioms encode determinism, idempotency, and monotonic convergence.
- Platform provider contract defines what the runtime must guarantee.
- Business model reinforces alignment between governance and outcomes.
