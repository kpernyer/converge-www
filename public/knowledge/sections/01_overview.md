# Overview

Converge exists to bring semantic governance to agentic workflows. The core
promise is deterministic, auditable convergence to an explainable result.

## Key Points

- Converge treats truth as executable constraints, not just documentation.
- Convergence is the primary safety mechanism, not a best-effort retry.
- Semantic authority stays in the engine, not in transport or agents.
