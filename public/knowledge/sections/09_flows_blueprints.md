# Flows and Blueprints

Flows and Blueprints define orchestration across Packs and end-to-end outcomes.

## Key Points

- Blueprints are curated Pack compositions for repeatable outcomes.
- Flows capture cross-pack orchestration and governance gates.
- `converge-domain` blueprints include Truths, features, and YAML wiring.
- Cross-pack flows in `converge-domain/cross-pack-flows` define orchestration templates.
