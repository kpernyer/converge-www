# Converge: Semantic Governance & Alignment

> Converge is a vision for **semantic governance**. We move from fragmented intent to unified, converged states through a deterministic alignment engine. Our mission is to provide a stable foundation for complex decision-making where human authority and AI agency coexist in a transparent, explainable ecosystem.
